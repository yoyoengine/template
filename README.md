# Template

This is an example template for a yoyoengine game.

## Quickstart

1. Open this project
    - If you created this inside of yoyoeditor, open yoyoeditor and then open this project with the "Open Project" option.
    - If you created this outside of yoyoeditor, open yoyoeditor and then open this directory with the "Open Existing Project" option.
2. Configure the project
    - Open the bottom left build settings panel, and configure the project build settings to your liking, then save!
3. Build the project
    - Press the hammer and gear icon to configure and build your project, then the play button to run it.

## Pushing to source control

If you created this project through yoyoeditor, this will reside inside a directory tracked by git. To push this to your own repository, you will need to create a new repository on github, and then push this project to it.

1. Create a new remote repository
2. Add the remote url
    - `git remote add origin <url>`
3. Add and commit the project
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. Push the project
    - `git push -u origin main`
